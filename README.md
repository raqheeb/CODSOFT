# CODSOFT Internship – Task 4: SMS Spam Detection  

This project is part of my **CODSOFT Internship** where I completed **Task 4: Spam SMS Detection** using Python and Machine Learning.  

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal is to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham (legitimate)** using NLP techniques and a Machine Learning model.  

## 🚀 Steps
1. Load and clean the SMS Spam Collection dataset.  
2. Transform text into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.  
3. Train a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier.  
4. Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.  
5. Save the trained model for future predictions.
